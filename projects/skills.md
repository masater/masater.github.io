# Personal Expertiese
If I was to write down everything I ever learned I would never get anywhere. Therefore I shall give an incomplete list of various skills and fields of knowledge I acquired over the years, during my studies, and other situations.

## Mathematical Skills
During my school, university and research years I acquired a strong mathematical fundament including:
- Analysis & Complex Analysis
- Linear Algebra
- Vector Geometry
- Representation Theory
- Statistics
- Data Analysis
- etc.

## Physics Knowledge
During my studies I specialized in particle, HEP-, and GSW-physics. However this is not to say I did not develop an expertiese in plenty of other fields:
- Newtonian Mechanics
- Electrodynamics
- Quantum Mechanics
- Electroweak Theory
- GSW - Physics
- General & Special Relativity
- Quantum optics
- Thermodynamics
- etc.
