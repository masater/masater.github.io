# API - Application Programming Interface
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is essentially a collection of rules and protocols that define how a software A interacts with software B, without requiring to know the internals of software A.
Essentially an API allows you to use a prebuilt software block without knowing its internals. You are given a list of possible operations, requirements for possible inputs, and specifications for output... It's as easy as that!
