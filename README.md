Wellcome to this repository, where I will try and document and share most of my public projects.
I will try to make this repository a documentation catalogue, to remind me how to do things. Due to my primary focus lying on other projects, this repository will gradually catch up to things I previously did, as well as being updated accordingly to my schedule.
