## A Brief Introduction
Wellcome to this repository, where I will try and document and share some of my knowledge and projects. Most of them unfortunately are confidential or closed source - depending on individual situations I will still be able to superficially share parts of them.
While I understand the importance of good, clear communication, I will try to keep my texts clean, short and concise - which may feel odd at times, but I am sure every programmer etc. will understand.
## What I use this Repo for
Every once in a while I end up asking myself how to do something... something I knew how to do, but now cannot remember as it is something little, finicky, or I just haven't had to do it in ages. This is my personal use case for this repo, and I aim to document these little things in the encyclopaedia, in the how_to folder.
Personally I keep a clone of this repo on my computer at all times, as I I find myself without internet at times. Feel free to do the same.
## A little Caviat
Due to my primary focus lying on other projects, this repository will gradually catch up to things I previously did, as well as being updated accordingly to my schedule.
