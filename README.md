## A Brief Introduction
Wellcome to my github, I am an ex-particle physicist searching for new adventures. In this and many of my repositories I will try and document some of my projects, code and knowledge. Most of my projects are unfortunately closed source or confidential - thus the what I am able to share will vary based on the project.

## Portfolio
My Projects:
- Quiz app
- gesture based cursor control
- Plastic Scintillation Detector Exhibition Prototype
- "Footscan -> Custom Insoles" - backend

## A little Caviat
Due to my primary focus lying on other projects, this repository will gradually catch up to things I previously did, as well as being updated accordingly to my schedule.
