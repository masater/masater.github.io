  <h1>Welcome to my GitHub Page!</h1>
  <p>Here I will try and document and share most of my public projects. I will try to make this page a documentation catalogue, to remind me how to do things. Due to my primary focus lying on other projects, this page will gradually catch up to things I previously did, as well as bein updated accordingly to my schedule.</p>
