  <h1>Welcome to my GitHub Page!</h1>
  <p>Here I will try and document and share most of my public projects. I will try to make this page a documentation catalogue, to remind me how to do things. <br>Due to my primary focus lying on other projects, this page will gradually catch up to things I previously did, as well as being updated accordingly to my schedule.</p>
  <p>I will prioritize my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/masater/masater.github.io" class="github-link" target="_blank">Repository</a> before styling this site. So check out that as well.<br>If currently there is not much around, make sure to check this out again a bit later.<br> - Masater (alias)</p>
